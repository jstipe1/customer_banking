# customer_banking
Module_3_Challenge

The purpose of this exercise was to practice utilizing Classes in python as well as calling functions.  Additionally, the challenge provided more opportunities to review creating equations in python.

There are three sections to this challenge
	1) savings_account.py establishes a function for calculating the interest earned on a savings account for a given number of months.  A simple growth rate calculation was requested here rather than a compound interest rate. User inputs were added in this section in order to check the equations.
	
	2) cd_account.py similar to the savings_account.py this section establishes a function for calculating the interest earned on a savings account for a given number of months.  A simple growth rate calculation was requested here rather than a compound interest rate. User inputs were added in this section in order to check the equations.
	
	3) The final section customer_banking.py combines the two previous functions, and asks the user to input the specifics of each account (begining balance, interest rate, and months).  Interest earned and updated balances are provided via print statements.
